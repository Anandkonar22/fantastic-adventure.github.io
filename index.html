                        <h1>I Love You, Amruta</h1>
                        <p>
                            My Darling Amruta,<br><br>
                            I hope this letter finds you well. I’ve been thinking a lot about everything that’s happened, and I want to start by saying how deeply sorry I am. I know that words alone can’t erase the pain I’ve caused, but I hope they can begin to mend the hurt and show you how much you mean to me.<br><br>
                            First and foremost, I want to apologize for the broken promises. When I made those promises to you, I genuinely intended to keep them. I know I’ve let you down, and I understand how much that has hurt you. The circumstances and situations I found myself in were unexpected, but I take full responsibility for not handling them in a way that honored my commitments to you. I promise you that I am committed to fulfilling those promises, even if I am a little late.<br><br>
                            I am truly sorry for leaving you alone during your hardest times. It breaks my heart to think that I wasn’t there for you when you needed me the most. You deserved my support, my presence, and my love, and I failed to provide that. I can only imagine how lonely and abandoned you must have felt, and for that, I am profoundly sorry.<br><br>
                            Please know that I am not making excuses for my actions. I acknowledge my mistakes and the pain they have caused you. You have always been there for me, and I should have been there for you. I am committed to doing better and being the partner you deserve.<br><br>
                            I also want to apologize for any hurtful words or actions that came from our fight. Emotions ran high, and in the heat of the moment, I said things I didn’t mean and acted in ways that were hurtful. I deeply regret any pain I caused and am truly sorry for not handling things better.<br><br>
                            You are incredibly important to me, and I value our relationship more than anything. I want us to move past this and grow stronger together. I am dedicated to making things right and proving to you that my love and commitment are unwavering.<br><br>
                            Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I am here for you, ready to listen, and ready to work on rebuilding our trust and love.<br><br>
                            With all my love and deepest apologies,<br>
                            Anand
